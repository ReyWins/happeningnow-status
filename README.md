Welcome to the **official public status repository** for **Happening Now** — a modern, privacy-focused news and discovery platform.

This repository powers our **live uptime monitoring**, **incident tracking**, and **historical performance reporting**, giving full transparency into the health of our platform and its underlying data providers.

## 📈 Live Status Dashboard

👉 **View the live status page:**  
**https://status.happeningnow.news**

This dashboard shows current availability, response times, and historical uptime for every monitored service.

---

## 🛠 How This Works

This status system is powered by **[Upptime](https://upptime.js.org)** and GitHub’s native tooling:

- **GitHub Actions** run scheduled uptime checks
- **Issues** are automatically created for incidents
- **Commits** store uptime and latency history
- **Graphs** are generated from real performance data
- **GitHub Pages** (and custom domain) serve the public dashboard

No third-party monitoring vendors. No black boxes.

## 🧠 Transparency & Trust

We believe:

- Status pages should be **honest**, not marketing tools
- Downtime should be **visible**, not hidden
- Performance trends matter just as much as uptime

If something is degraded or down, you’ll see it here.
